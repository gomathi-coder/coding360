# Introduction

## What is Naive Bayes?

- A powerful machine learning algorithm based on probability
- Uses Bayes' Theorem to make predictions
- Like asking "What's the probability this belongs to each category?"

> **Key Idea:** Calculate probabilities for each class and pick the highest!

# Real-World Scenario

## The Movie Critic's Challenge 🎬

*Netflix wants to automatically classify movie reviews as Positive or Negative to help users find good movies.*

### Available Data:
Past movie reviews  
- Review text (words used)  
- Sentiment label (Positive/Negative)  

> **Question:** Can we predict if a new review is positive or negative?

# Our Dataset

## 12 Movie Reviews

| Review | Key Words           | Sentiment |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1      | amazing, great      | Positive  |
| 2      | terrible, boring    | Negative  |
| 3      | excellent, amazing  | Positive  |
| 4      | awful, terrible     | Negative  |
| 5      | great, excellent    | Positive  |
| 6      | boring, bad         | Negative  |
| 7      | fantastic, great    | Positive  |
| 8      | terrible, awful     | Negative  |
| 9      | amazing, excellent  | Positive  |

| 11     | great, fantastic    | Positive  |
| 12     | bad, awful          | Negative  |

### Pattern Recognition:
- 😊 "amazing", "great", "excellent" → Usually Positive  
- 😞 "terrible", "boring", "awful" → Usually Negative

# New Review Arrives

## Meet the Mystery Review 📝

A new review comes in:

> *"This movie was great and amazing!"*

**Netflix thinks:** *"What's the probability this is positive vs negative based on the words used?"*

> This is exactly what Naive Bayes does! 🎯

# Algorithm Steps

## How Naive Bayes Works (4 Simple Steps)

### 1. Count Word Frequencies 📊  
How often each word appears in positive/negative reviews

### 2. Calculate Probabilities 🧮  
Convert counts to probabilities

### 3. Apply Bayes' Theorem 🔬  
Calculate probability for each class

### 4. Pick Highest Probability 🏆  
Winner takes all!

# Word Frequency Count

## Step 1 - Word Frequency Count

### Let's Count Words in Our Training Data

#### Positive Reviews (6 total):
- "amazing": appears **3 times**  
- "great": appears **3 times**  
- "excellent": appears **3 times**  
- "terrible": appears **0 times**

#### Negative Reviews (6 total):
- "terrible": appears **3 times**  
- "boring": appears **2 times**  
- "amazing": appears **0 times**  
- "great": appears **0 times**

# Basic Probabilities

## Step 2 - Calculate Basic Probabilities

**Prior Probabilities (Class Distribution):**  
P(Positive) = 6/12 = **50%**  
P(Negative) = 6/12 = **50%**

**Word Probabilities in Positive Reviews:**  
P("amazing"|Positive) = 3/12 = **25%**  
P("great"|Positive) = 3/12 = **25%**

**Word Probabilities in Negative Reviews:**  
P("amazing"|Negative) = 0/12 = **0%** ⚠️  
P("great"|Negative) = 0/12 = **0%** ⚠️

*Problem: Zero probabilities!*

# Zero Probability Problem

## Houston, We Have a Problem! 🚨

If a word never appears in a class, probability = 0  
This makes the entire calculation = 0 (multiplication!)

> ### Solution: Laplace Smoothing
> - Add +1 to every word count  
> - Add vocabulary size to denominator  
> - No more zero probabilities!

**Magic Formula:**  
`(Count + 1) / (Total + Vocabulary Size)`

---

# Interactive Calculation

## Let's Apply Smoothing Together!

**Vocabulary size = 8 words**

**Your turn to calculate:**  
P("amazing"|Positive) = (3+1)/(12+8) = ?/?  = ?  
<button>Show Answer</button>  
**Answer:** 4/20 = **0.2 (20%)**

**Now try:**  
P("amazing"|Negative) = (0+1)/(12+8) = ?/?  = ?  
<button>Show Answer</button>  
**Answer:** 1/20 = **0.05 (5%)**

## All Word Probabilities

| Word      | P(Word|Positive) | P(Word|Negative) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| amazing   | **0.20**         | 0.05             |
| great     | **0.20**         | 0.05             |
| excellent | **0.20**         | 0.05             |
| fantastic | **0.15**         | 0.05             |
| terrible  | 0.05             | **0.20**         |
| boring    | 0.05             | **0.15**         |
| awful     | 0.05             | **0.20**         |
| bad       | 0.05             | **0.15**         |

> **Notice:** Positive words have high probability in positive class!

# Apply Bayes Theorem

## Step 3 - Apply Bayes' Theorem  
### Classifying "great amazing"

**For Positive:**  
P(Positive|"great amazing") = P("great"|Positive) × P("amazing"|Positive) × P(Positive)  
= 0.20 × 0.20 × 0.50 = **0.02**

**For Negative:**  
P(Negative|"great amazing") = P("great"|Negative) × P("amazing"|Negative) × P(Negative)  
= 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.50 = **0.00125**

# Make Prediction

## Step 4 - Make Prediction  
### Compare Probabilities

| Class    | Probability | Winner? |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Positive | **0.020**   | 🏆      |
| Negative | 0.00125     |         |

**Prediction: POSITIVE** 😊  
**Confidence: 0.02/(0.02+0.00125) = 94.1%**

> **Why it works:** Both "great" and "amazing" are much more likely in positive reviews!

# Negative Example Results

## Classifying "terrible boring"

**For Positive:**  
P(Positive|"terrible boring") = 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.50 = **0.00125**

**For Negative:**  
P(Negative|"terrible boring") = 0.20 × 0.15 × 0.50 = **0.015**

| Class    | Probability | Winner? |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Positive | 0.00125     |         |
| Negative | **0.015**   | 🏆      |

**Prediction: NEGATIVE** 😞  
**Confidence: 92.3%**

# Confusing Case

## What About Mixed Reviews?

### New Review: "great terrible" 🤔  
*One positive word, one negative word*

**For Positive:** 0.20 × 0.05 × 0.50 = **0.005**  
**For Negative:** 0.05 × 0.20 × 0.50 = **0.005**

### Result: TIE! 🤝  
Both classes have equal probability (0.005)

> **This shows the algorithm's uncertainty with conflicting signals!**

# Why Naive

## Why "Naive"? 🤓

> ### The Independence Assumption  
> **Naive Bayes assumes:**  
> - Words are **independent** of each other  
> - "great" and "amazing" don't influence each other  

### Reality:
- Words often relate to each other  
- "not great" vs "great" - context matters!

**But it works anyway!** 🎉  
*Simple assumptions often lead to powerful results*
