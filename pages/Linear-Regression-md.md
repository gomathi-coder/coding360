## The Goal

### Find the Best-Fit Line

**Mathematical Form:** y = mx + b

#### Where:
- **y** = Ice cream sales (what we predict)
- **x** = Temperature (what we know)
- **m** = Slope (how much sales change per degree)
- **b** = Intercept (theoretical sales at 0°F)

> **Mission:** Find the values of m and b that create the best line! 🎯

## Algorithm Steps

### How Linear Regression Works (4 Steps)

#### 1. Calculate Means 📊
Average temperature and average sales

#### 2. Calculate Slope (m) 📈
How steep should our line be?

#### 3. Calculate Intercept (b) 📍
Where does the line cross the y-axis?

#### 4. Make Predictions 🔮
Use the equation to predict new values

## Step 1 - Calculate Means

### Find the Center Point

#### Mean Temperature (X̄):
(65+70+72+75+78+80+82+85+88+90+68+86) ÷ 12 = **78.25°F**

#### Mean Sales (Ȳ):
(80+100+110+130+140+160+170+190+200+220+90+195) ÷ 12 = **148.75 cups**

> **Center Point:** (78.25°F, 148.75 cups) 📍
> *Our best-fit line will pass through this center point!*

## Step 2 - Slope Formula

### Calculate Slope (m)

**Slope Formula:**
m = Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)] / Σ[(Xi - X̄)²]

#### Let's calculate one example together:
**Day 1:** Temperature = 65°F, Sales = 80 cups

- (Xi - X̄) = 65 - 78.25 = **-13.25**
- (Yi - Ȳ) = 80 - 148.75 = **-68.75**
- (Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ) = (-13.25) × (-68.75) = **910.94**
- (Xi - X̄)² = (-13.25)² = **175.56**

## Interactive Calculation

### Your Turn! 🤝

**Day 2:** Temperature = 70°F, Sales = 100 cups

**Calculate:**
- (Xi - X̄) = 70 - 78.25 = ?
- (Yi - Ȳ) = 100 - 148.75 = ?
- (Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ) = ? × ? = ?

<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answers:**
- (Xi - X̄) = **-8.25**
- (Yi - Ȳ) = **-48.75**
- (Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ) = **402.19**

</details>

## Complete Slope Calculation

### After calculating for all 12 days:

- **Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)] = 4,293.78**
- **Σ[(Xi - X̄)²] = 754.42**

**Slope (m) = 4,293.78 ÷ 754.42 = 5.69**

> **What does this mean?** 🤔
> *For every 1°F increase in temperature, ice cream sales increase by 5.69 cups!*

## Step 3 - Calculate Intercept

### Find the Y-Intercept

**Intercept Formula:**
b = Ȳ - m × X̄

**Calculation:**
- b = 148.75 - 5.69 × 78.25
- b = 148.75 - 445.24
- b = **-296.49**

> **What does this mean?** 🤔
> *Theoretical sales at 0°F (not practically meaningful)*

## Our Final Equation

### 🎉 The Best-Fit Line is Found!

**Ice Cream Sales = 5.69 × Temperature - 296.49**

#### Example Calculations:
- At 70°F: Sales = 5.69 × 70 - 296.49 = **102 cups**
- At 80°F: Sales = 5.69 × 80 - 296.49 = **159 cups**
- At 90°F: Sales = 5.69 × 90 - 296.49 = **215 cups**

> *Does this make sense?* ✅

## Step 4 - Make Prediction

### Tomorrow's Forecast: 77°F 🌤️

**Prediction Calculation:**
- Sales = 5.69 × 77 - 296.49
- Sales = 438.13 - 296.49
- Sales = **141.64 cups**

> **Maria's Answer:** *"I should prepare about 142 cups for tomorrow!"*

> **Confidence Check:** This falls right in line with our data pattern! ✅

## Testing Different Scenarios

### What-If Analysis 🔍

| Temperature | Calculation | Predicted Sales | Scenario |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| 60°F | 5.69×60-296.49 | **45 cups** | Cold day ❄️ |
| 75°F | 5.69×75-296.49 | **130 cups** | Nice day ☀️ |
| 85°F | 5.69×85-296.49 | **187 cups** | Hot day 🔥 |
| 95°F | 5.69×95-296.49 | **244 cups** | Heat wave 🌡️ |

- Weekends vs weekdays
- Holidays and events
- Competition nearby
- Marketing promotions

#### ❌ Assumes Linear Relationship:
- What if it levels off at very high temperatures?
- Real relationships might be curved
